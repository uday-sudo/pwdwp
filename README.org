* pwdwp
** Password manager written in python.
+ Purpose of making this is to learn new stuff
+ I want to create a linux app with a rofi like quick acess password copypaste menu
** Personal Planning
- Every entry will have the following fields
  - service
  - username
  - email
  - password
** Dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC
pip install pysqlite3 pyperclip
#+END_SRC
** I would not use this since this is in the "Just works category" and also isn't actually that good i just made it to learn GUI's
